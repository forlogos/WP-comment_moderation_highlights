# Comment Moderation Highlights

## Introduction

Highlight comments in the Comments Admin. Pick a color, add a note.

Highlight comments with a background color in the WordPress Comments Admin pages. Choose the criteria for highlighting a comment, add a note to show it with, and pick the highlight color.

This plugin is "for internal use" and only highlights comments within the WordPress Comments admin. The typical use case for this plugin is to inform/remind users about what to do for a particular type of comment. Examples:

* Comments from John Doe - Always approve unless it's about topic XYZ

* Comments from IP 12.34.56.78 - Give a personal, non-standard response to these comments

You can highlight a comment based on the contents of the commentor's name, email, or IP address.
