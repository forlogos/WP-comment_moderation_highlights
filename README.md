# Comment Moderation Highlights

## Introduction

Highlight comments within the WordPress Comments Admin pages. Choose the criteria for highlighting a comment, a note to show with it, and the actual highlight color.

This plugin is "for internal use" and only highlights comments within the WordPress Comments admin. The typical use case for this plugin is to inform/remind users about what to do for a particular type of comment. Examples:

Comments from John Doe - Always approve his comments, unless he talks about topic XYZ.
Comments from IP xx.xx.xx.xx - Always give a personal, non-standard response to these comments
